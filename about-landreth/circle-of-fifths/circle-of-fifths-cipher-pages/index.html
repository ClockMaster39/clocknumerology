            <h2>How Was The "Circle of Fifths" Cipher Made?</h2>
            <p>
                How? '1' is the universal starting point. Therefore, letter 'A' is 1. The octave of the first note in the c-major key is the 8th note. Therefore letter 'B' is 8. Letter 'C' is the first note in the c-major key. Therefore letter 'C' is 1. G is the 5th note in the c-major key, therfore letter 'D' is 5. And so on through letter 'M'. Keep in mind that Gb is four and a half notes from the first note in the c-major key. Therefore letter 'I' is 45.

                    "This cipher was inspired by the mechanics of music theory -based solely on the c-major key. It is important to know that this cipher is mirrored from letters 'N' through 'Z'. For example, 'N=65', 'O=25', 'P=55', 'Q=15', etc etc."<br>
