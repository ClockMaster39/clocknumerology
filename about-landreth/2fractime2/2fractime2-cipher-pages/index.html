            <h2>How Was The "2FracTime2" Cipher Made?</h2>
            <p>  
            The letter 'A' is assigned a value of '1' because '1' is the universal starting-point. What is 1 p.m.? Correct! This gives the letter 'B' a value of '13'. For 'C' we study the 1 hour-marker. Hour-Marker '1' is opposite '7'. Thus 1 / 7 ≈ 0.14. Letter 'C' now has a temporary value of '14'. What is '1' p.m.? Correct! 14 (from previous) + 13 = 27. Finally, 2 x 7 = 14. We conclude letter 'C' has a value of '14'. For Letter 'D', study the 2nd Hour Marker just like you did for Letter 'C'. Continue through letter 'M'.
