            <h2>How Was The "25th-Hour" Cipher Made?</h2>
            <p>
                Only this cipher (&amp; the 'Clock Numerology' Cipher) are the only two ciphers I do not remember how I got the numbers. The one thing I DO remember about 25th-Hour is that it was based on the philosophy of 'What if the day started at the 1-hour-marker?' (hence the name '25th-Hour'). Other than that, I do not remember exactly how I got the numbers for the 25th-Hour Cipher.

                    "All of my clock numerology ciphers were inspired by the mechanics of time. It is important to know that this cipher is mirrored from letters 'N' through 'Z'. For example, 'N=10', 'O=4', 'P=16', 'Q=10', etc etc."<br>
